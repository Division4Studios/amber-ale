# Amber-Ale 🍺

Amber-Ale is a **modular, open-source, multi-tenant platform** designed to be **customizable and extensible** for communities, businesses, and creative projects. 

Inspired by **Foundry VTT’s modding approach**, Amber-Ale provides a **flexible, self-hosted foundation** where users can install and configure **mods** to build their own unique experiences—whether for **roleplay communities, data management, business automation, or app development**.

## 🚀 Current Status: Early Development
Amber-Ale is in **active development**. Follow along as we build a **plugin-driven ecosystem** where users can create and manage their own tenant-based platforms.

## 🎯 **Key Features (Planned)**
- **🔌 Extensible Plugin System** – Supports **TypeScript-based mods** for customization.  
- **🏗 Multi-Tenant Support** – Create multiple independent **systems within a single instance**.  
- **📦 Marketplace for Mods** – Browse, install, and manage **mods per tenant** without restarting.  
- **🔄 JavaScript Interactive API** – A modding API **instead of direct backend API calls**.  
- **🔔 Custom Event Pub/Sub** – Mods can **register, subscribe to, and trigger system events**.  
- **🛠 Flexible Database Backend** – Supports **PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MS SQL Server**.  
- **🌐 Deploy Anywhere** – Install via **Digital Ocean, local hosting, or cloud services**.
