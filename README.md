# Amber-Ale 🍺

Amber-Ale is a **modular, open-source, multi-tenant platform** designed for communities, businesses, and creative projects. Inspired by Foundry VTT’s modding approach, Amber-Ale enables users to create independent systems with **custom plugins, events, and interactive APIs**.

Follow along as we build a flexible, plugin-driven ecosystem.
