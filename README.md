# Amber-Ale 🍺

Amber-Ale is a **modular, open-source, multi-tenant platform** designed to be **customizable and extensible** for communities, businesses, and creative projects.

Amber-Ale provides a **flexible, self-hosted foundation** where users can install and configure **modules** to build their own unique experiences—whether for **roleplay communities, data management, business automation, or app development**.

## 🚀 Current Status: Early Development
Amber-Ale is in **active development**. Follow along as we build a **module-driven ecosystem** where users can create and manage their own tenant-based platforms.

- **🛠 Flexible Database Backend** – Supports **PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MS SQL Server**.  
- **🎨 Vue 3 UI Framework** – Modules extend the UI via a **core component library** with theming support.
